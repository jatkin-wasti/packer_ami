# Packer
## Installing packer

## What are packer files?
- Packer files are written in JSON format
- These files act as a template to build virtual machines by specifying the OS and the state of the hardrive
- It can do this by creatin AMI's in the state that is required
- EC2 Instances can then be created based on that AMI with all of the provisioning already completed
- Services may still need scripts to run or restart them when the instances are created
